# MVA_BayesianBackprop

This code is for the project of the course "Fondements théoriques du deep learning" of master MVA 2020. We propose several numerical experiments to illustrate the methods developped in [1].


## Experiments

We provide notebooks to run experiments:
* [Non-linear regression with "Bayesian by backprop"](regression.ipynb)
* [Contextual bandit with "Bayesian by backprop" on mushrooms data set](RL.ipynb)

## Pyro

In [Pyro](Pyro) you will find a work in progress on an implementation of the "Bayes by backprop" method in Pyro for non-linear regression.
